			<div class="c-article__block">
				<p>My name is Atanas and I am a senior JavaScript/TypeScript developer.</p>

				<p>I am currently located in Varna, Bulgaria. That's on the south-east side of Europe, on the Black Sea.</p>

				<p>I started my web development career in 2010 as an apprentice to a hardcore freelancer and pretty fast learned the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>

				<p>We had our own small coding company - <a href="http://html-lab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML Lab</a>. In this company I was doing the front-end part and was mainly focused on slicing design files and turning them into static HTML pages.</p>

				<h3>First real job</h3>

				<p>Between 2012 and 2018 I was full-time employed in one of the larges companies in Varna, Bulgaria - 2create. In this company I worked for some of the biggest PSD to HTML brands out there - htmlBurger and htmlBoutique. I developed thousands (yes thousands) of different projects for clients from all over the globe and was focused on the front-end part of all projects.</p>

				<p>I participated in defining, integrating and teaching the internal coding standards in the company and was a mentor to several front-end developers.</p>

				<h3>JavaScript</h3>

				<p>During my employment between 2012 and 2018 I developed, integrated and maintained the internal build systems for the company. This included mastering CSS pre- and post-processors such as LESS, SASS/SCSS and PostCSS, task runners such as Gulp and Grunt, module bundlers such as Webpack and Rollup, and NodeJS which I used as a runtime.</p>

				<p>Along these technologies I mastered JavaScript and it became my preferred coding language. I also presented a keynote on the features introduced in 2015 with the 6th version of ECMAScript (the JavaScript standard).</p>

			<div class="c-article__block">
				<h3>Progress</h3>

				<p>Since the beginning of 2018 and until early 2019 I worked as a JavaScript developer in a small startup located in Varna and operating internationally.</p>

				<p>In Three 11 we were focused on providing the best possible quality while using bleeding edge technologies. We worked on several in-house projects along with some interesting client websites and applications.</p>

				<h2>Today</h2>

				<p>Now I am a JavaScript and TypeScript developer with more than 8 years of professional experience. I am focused on the front-end but using a lot of back-end technologies as well. <br>My daily tasks include coding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Bash...</p>

				<p>The latest project I worked on is a large international IoT application for one of the world's largest investor-owned electric utility service providers which aims to provide users from all over Europe with the ability to control their homes' smart appliances and energy consumption.</p>
