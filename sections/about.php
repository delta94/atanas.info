			<h2>About me</h2>

			<div class="c-article__block">
				<p>My name is Atanas and I am a Senior JavaScript/TypeScript Developer.</p>

				<p>I am currently located in Varna, Bulgaria. That's on the south-east side of Europe, on the Black Sea.</p>

				<p>Many friends refer to me as "uncle" because I was born in the previous millennium but I am actually not that old. <br>Being born in the 1980s has its pros and cons.</p>

				<p>The main pro about it is the fact that I've had enough time to decide what matters to me.</p>

				<h3>I love coding!</h3>

				<p>I started doing this in 2010 as an apprentice to a hardcore freelancer and pretty fast learned the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>

				<p>We even had our own small coding "company" - <a href="http://html-lab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML Lab</a>. In this company I participated as a frontend developer and was mainly focused on slicing design files and turning them into static HTML pages.</p>

			<div class="c-article__block">
				<h3>It went serious:</h3>

				<p>Between 2012 and 2018 I was full-time employed in one of the larges companies in Varna - 2create. In this company I worked for some of the biggest PSD to HTML brands out there - htmlBurger and htmlBoutique. I worked on thousands (yes thousands) of different projects for clients from all over the globe and was focused on the frontend part of all projects.</p>

			<div class="c-article__block">
				<h3>I've grown up.</h3>

				<p>In 2create I worked as a frontend developer and my daily tasks included slicing of design files (mainly PhotoShop, but also on Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD, etc.) and converting them into a pixel-perfect HTML and CSS pages.</p>

				<p>As months went by, I started using pre- and post-processors in CSS and slowly mastered LESS, SASS and POSTCSS which opened the way for learning how to use task runners such as Grunt, Gulp and Webpack.</p>
			</div><!-- /.c-article__block -->

			<div class="c-article__block">
				<h3>Enter JavaScript!</h3>

				<p>Along CSS and all build tools, I've learned and mastered JavaScript and it became my preferred language. <br>I love it and it appears it shares the feelings.</p>

				<p>Since the beginning of 2018 and until early 2019 I worked as a Senior JavaScript developer in a small startup located in Varna and operating internationally.</p>

				<p>In Three 11 we were focused on providing the best possible quality while using bleeding edge technologies. We worked on several in-house projects along with some interesting client websites and applications.</p>

				<h2>Today</h2>

				<p>Now I am a JavaScript and TypeScript developer with more than 8 years of professional experience. I am focused on the frontend but using a lot of back-end technologies as well. <br>My daily tasks include coding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Bash...</p>

				<p>The latest project I worked on is a large international IoT application for one of the world's largest investor-owned electric utility service providers which aims to provide users from all over Europe with the ability to control their homes' smart appliances and energy consumption.</p>
