			<h2>About me</h2>

			<div class="c-article__block">
				<p>My name is Atanas and I am a Senior Web Developer.</p>

				<p>I am currently located in Varna, Bulgaria.</p>

				<p>Many friends refer to me as "uncle" because I was born in the previous millennium but I am actually not that old. <br>Being born in the 1980s has its pros and cons.</p>

				<p>The main pro about it is the fact that I've had enough time to decide what matters to me.</p>

				<h3>I love coding!</h3>

				<p>I started doing this in 2010 as an apprentice to a hardcore freelancer and pretty fast learned the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>

				<p>Between 2012 and 2018 i was full-time employed in one of the best companies in my city 2create and worked for some of the best PSDtoHTML brands out there.</p>

				<h3>I've grown up.</h3>

				<p>I started as a front-end developer and my daily tasks included HTML and CSS coding.</p>

				<p>As months went by, i started using pre- and post-processors in CSS and slowly mastered LESS, SASS and POSTCSS which opened the way for learning how to use task runners such as Grunt, Gulp and Webpack.</p>
			</div><!-- /.c-article__block -->

			<div class="c-article__block">
				<p>Along CSS i learned JavaScript and it became my preferred language. <br>I love it and it appears it shares the feelings.</p>

				<p>Since the beginning of 2018 i am employed in a start-up company located in Varna and operating internationally.</p>

				<h3>The best day ever</h3>

				<p>In the late 2015 a magical thing happened that transformed my entire life and gave it a new purpose: <br>My beloved wife gave birth to our first child - Stefan. <br>Our lives have new meaning now. <br>This is the best thing that can happen to a man!</p>
