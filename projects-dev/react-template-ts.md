## Supported Browsers

This setup uses [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) to target browsers.

The default list of supported browsers is listed in the `package.json` file:

```json
{
	"browserslist": ["> 1%", "last 2 versions"]
}
```

This means that supported browsers vary based on current usage data and current browser versions.

In general, this setup supports the two most recent versions of all browsers.

## Bonus

The start template contains a ready-to-use auth flow with Login, Logout, Sign up and Forgotten password forms with validation included. The auth flow includes also route guarding and redirects based on auth status. Please take a look at the `/src/containers/auth` folder for more details.

The starting files also include ready-to-use layout components such as `Header`, `Footer`, `Wrapper`, `Button`, `Icon` and form `Field`s.
